Build histograms of features over random subsets from the training sets. Due to the small sample set we are currently using the entire example sets and trying to visually observe differences among classes. The histograms for the features are created depending on the feature data type, as mentioned in [https://books.google.de/books?id=uZxOCgAAQBAJ&dq=machine+learning+histograms+to+identify+features&hl=ro&source=gbs_navlinks_s], chapter 3, page 61:

    * continuous features - "examine the mean and standard deviation of each feature to get a sense of the central tendency and variation of the values within the dataset for the feature"
