There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.

##Data observation & exploration
  - visually scan for relevant features in each repository class and identify predictor feature candidates
  
  
##Data collection
  - answer questions like: do we need to map specific endpoints to numerical / categorical values? 

##Data analysis
  - build visual assessments of feature correlations and target class
  - use the feature candidates in plots and assert their value

##Build prediction model
  - use information gained in previous milestone to nail down a usable prediction model

##Learning algorithm 
  - identify possible learning algorithms and evaluate suitability based on literature review
  - decide and train the model

##Performance analysis
