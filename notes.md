We’re going to assume that we have a set of labeled examples of the categories we want
to learn how to identify. These examples consist of a label, which we’ll also call a class
or type, and a series of measured variables that describe each example. We’ll call these
measurements features or predictors. The height and weight columns we worked with
earlier are examples of features that we could use to guess the “male” and “female”
labels we were working with before. [Machine Learning for Hackers, chapter 3] (http://pdf.th7.cn/down/files/1312/machine_learning_for_hackers.pdf)
