## Your challenge, should you choose to accept it
1. Clone this repo (or download the zip archive) to get started.
2. The page should look like [business_overview.png](business_overview.png) on the page load:
    
    <img src="business_overview.png" alt="alt text" width="250"/>
3. The page should look like [business_overview_expanded.png](business_overview_expanded.png) when the "more" links are clicked:
    
    <img src="business_overview_expanded.png" alt="alt text" width="250"/>
4. The pencil icon should change color on hover.
5. The "New Program" button should open a form to add a new program. This is where you get some UX/design freedom, but the form should have the following fields:
    - Program Type (single select)
        + Count Series
        + Time Series
        + Membership
    - Program Name (input)
    - Allow online scheduling (boolean)
    - Default capacity (input)
    - Tabs this program is on (multi-select)
        + Classes
        + Appointments
        + Workshops
        + Outside
        + Inside
        + Gym
6. You may use any front-end libraries you wish to complete the task. The Internet is your oyster!
7. When you're finished, send a link to your GitHub repo (preferred) or a .zip archive to your point-of-contact. (Make sure you include your unminified code!) 
8. If your submitted work requires tooling (grunt, rails, yeoman, etc) is should also be hosted so that it can viewed in a working state.
