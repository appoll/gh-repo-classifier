This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
