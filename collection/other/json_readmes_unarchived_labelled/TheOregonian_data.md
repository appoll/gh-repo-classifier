# Data Guide
A public-facing guide to tools we use for data journalism!

## Tools

### Python 3

You can reproduce our environment for data cleaning and analysis with the Requirements file in this repo.

### Bash

I grew accustomed to `virtualenvwrapper`, but am happy to adopt the virtual environment capabilities baked into Python 3. So far I just use an alias to drop into this environment as quickly as possible: `alias dataenv="source ~/Envs/datateam/bin/activate"`. I imagine a more sophisticated tool already exists, and I'm happy to hear about it!

### Carto

IRE membership affords a free individual account. I don't have related code to share yet, but I encourage people to look into the tool. The organization has a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/CartoDB) too.
