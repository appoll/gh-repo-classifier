# Homework 1: Swift Playground

## Due
Wednesday, September 21 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In Homework 1, you will be working with Swift code inside an Xcode Playground.
This is a great place to play around with Swift without having to create entire
new projects. You can test out certain lines of code, make minor changes, and see the results of
them live (like an interpreted language). That said, Swift is compiled, and the
LLVM compiler will usually point out syntactic bugs via Xcode warnings and
errors. Use these to help you debug the code and answer the provided questions.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain
        YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. Add an upstream remote that points to our original repository.
4. **Complete swift.playground.**
5. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.
