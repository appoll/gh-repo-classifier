lme4pureR
=========

The penalized least squares (PLS) and penalized iteratively
reweighted least squares (PIRLS) algorithms from lme4, but written entirely
in pure R. The purposes of this package are:

1. clarify how PLS and PIRLS work without having to read through C++ code, 

2. as a sandbox for trying out modified versions of PLS and PIRLS,

3. as a companion to manuscripts describing the lmer and glmer functions.

Note: Currently, this branch of lme4pureR depends on the flexLambda branch of lme4.
